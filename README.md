# Book Reviews Sentiment Analyzer

A machine learning project that classifies book reviews as positive or negative using models like Linear SVM, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. I experimented with various feature extraction methods, including Bag of Words, CountVectorizer, and TfidfVectorizer, to preprocess the text data.

After training and evaluating multiple models, Logistic Regression emerged as the best performer with the highest accuracy and F1 score.
